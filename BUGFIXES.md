# Bug Fixes & Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Money Not Being Withdrawn on Upgrades
**Problem**: Sometimes upgrades didn't deduct points from the player's total.

**Root Cause**: The shop was using a stale copy of the game state. When the button's onClick handler was created, it captured the state at render time, but the actual state could have changed by the time the button was clicked.

**Solution**: Modified `src/ui/Shop.ts` to fetch a fresh copy of the state inside the click handler using `this.store.getState()` instead of using the captured state from render time.

**Files Changed**: `src/ui/Shop.ts`

### 2. ✅ Buy Buttons Flickering and Not Clickable
**Problem**: Buy buttons were flickering and sometimes clicks didn't register. This was caused by click events propagating from the shop to the game canvas.

**Root Cause**: The shop panel didn't have explicit pointer event handling, allowing clicks to potentially bubble to the canvas underneath.

**Solution**: Added `pointer-events: auto` to `#shop-panel` in `styles.css` to ensure the shop panel properly captures all pointer events and prevents propagation to the canvas.

**Files Changed**: `styles.css`

---

### 3. ✅ Level XP Getting Too High
**Problem**: The exponential XP requirement formula (`100 × 1.5^(level-1)`) made progression impossibly slow after just a few levels.

**Root Cause**: Exponential growth is too aggressive for an incremental game's early progression.

**Solution**: Changed to a linear progression formula: `10 + (level × 5)`. This provides steady, predictable progression that scales reasonably.

**Files Changed**: `src/math/ColorManager.ts`

**Balance Impact**:
- Level 2: Was 150 XP → Now 15 XP
- Level 5: Was ~500 XP → Now 30 XP
- Level 10: Was ~3,800 XP → Now 55 XP

### 4. ✅ Shots Coming from Behind the Ship
**Problem**: Lasers were spawning from the ship's center/back instead of the front tip.

**Root Cause**: `ship.getPosition()` returned the ship's center point, not the front where the laser should originate.

**Solution**: 
- Added `getFrontPosition()` method to `Ship` class that calculates the tip position based on the ship's angle and size
- Updated all laser spawn calls to use `getFrontPosition()` instead of `getPosition()`

**Files Changed**: 
- `src/entities/Ship.ts` (added `getFrontPosition()`)
- `src/Game.ts` (updated `fireVolley()` and `fireSingleShip()`)

---

### 5. ✅ Boss Fight Not Like Asteroids
**Problem**: Boss fights were just static ring ships clicking on a moving target. User wanted Asteroids-style gameplay.

**Solution**: Completely redesigned boss mode with player-controlled ship:

#### New Features:
1. **Player Ship Entity** (`src/entities/PlayerShip.ts`):
   - Rotation controls (Arrow Keys / A-D)
   - Thrust with inertia (Arrow Up / W)
   - Shooting with cooldown (Spacebar)
   - Screen wrapping (fly off one edge, appear on the other)
   - Visual thrust flame when moving fast
   - Physics: acceleration, max speed, friction

2. **Boss Mode Controls**:
   - Keyboard input system added to `Game.ts`
   - Separate control handling for boss vs normal mode
   - On-screen control instructions that appear during boss fights

3. **Mode-Specific Rendering**:
   - Normal mode: Ring of ships around the ball
   - Boss mode: Single player-controlled ship
   - Transitions hide/show appropriate UI elements

**Files Changed**:
- `src/entities/PlayerShip.ts` (NEW)
- `src/Game.ts` (major refactor for boss mode)
- `index.html` (added boss controls UI)

---

### 6. ✅ Auto-Attack Events Interfering with Buy Buttons
**Problem**: When auto-attack fired, shop buttons would visually flicker (turn black/white) as if being clicked, even though no user interaction occurred.

**Root Cause**: 
- Auto-attack's laser hits triggered `addPoints()`, which notified all store listeners
- The shop re-rendered every 50-100ms due to continuous point additions
- Each re-render destroyed and recreated all button DOM elements
- Browser applied `:active` pseudo-class during DOM manipulation, causing visual flicker
- Button event listeners were being recreated constantly, creating potential race conditions

**Solution**: 
1. **Purchase Locking**: Added `isProcessingPurchase` flag to prevent concurrent purchases and block re-renders during purchase operations
2. **Increased Debounce**: Changed shop re-render debounce from 50ms to 100ms to reduce render frequency
3. **Atomic State Updates**: Used `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure purchases complete atomically before allowing re-renders
4. **Event Isolation**: Added event capture on shop panel to prevent any event propagation to canvas
5. **CSS Improvements**: Changed `:active` state from transform to color change to reduce visual jarring

**Files Changed**: 
- `src/ui/Shop.ts` - Added purchase locking and atomic updates
- `src/ui/Button.ts` - Added click throttling
- `styles.css` - Improved button active state and event isolation

---

### 7. ✅ Fast Clicking/Buying Breaks the Game
**Problem**: Rapid clicking on buy buttons could cause multiple purchases to execute incorrectly, potentially spending more points than available or causing state corruption.

**Root Cause**: 
- Multiple click handlers could execute concurrently
- Each handler called `getState()` which returns a copy
- Multiple handlers could read the same state (e.g., `points: 100`) before any updates were applied
- This allowed purchases that shouldn't be affordable or multiple purchases when only one should succeed
- Classic race condition in concurrent state updates

**Solution**:
1. **Purchase Mutex**: Added `isProcessingPurchase` flag to ensure only one purchase can happen at a time
2. **Click Throttling**: Added 100ms delay between button clicks in `Button.ts` using timestamp tracking
3. **requestAnimationFrame**: Wrapped purchase logic in `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure updates happen in a single browser paint cycle
4. **Event Prevention**: Added `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` to all button click handlers
5. **Disabled Pointer Events**: Added `pointer-events: none` to disabled buttons in CSS
6. **Explicit Re-render**: Manually trigger re-render after purchase completes to update UI immediately

**Files Changed**: 
- `src/ui/Shop.ts` - Purchase locking and atomic updates
- `src/ui/Button.ts` - Click throttling with timestamp tracking
- `styles.css` - Added pointer-events protection

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Before: Race condition possible
onClick: () => {
  const state = getState();  // Multiple handlers get same state
  if (canBuy(state)) {
    buy(state);  // Multiple concurrent purchases!
  }
}

// After: Atomic and locked
onClick: () => {
  if (isProcessingPurchase) return;  // Guard
  isProcessingPurchase = true;
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {  // Atomic execution
    const state = getState();
    if (canBuy(state)) {
      buy(state);
    }
    isProcessingPurchase = false;
    render();  // Explicit update
  });
}
```

## Balance Changes

| Metric | Old Value | New Value | Reason |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|

| Laser Origin | Ship center | Ship front tip | Better visual accuracy |
| Boss Mode | Click-based | Player control | More engaging |
| Shot Cooldown | N/A | 200ms | Balance for boss mode |

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Shop Purchases**: Buy each upgrade multiple times, verify points deduct correctly
2. **Button Clicks**: Rapidly click buy buttons, ensure no flickering or missed clicks
3. **Auto-Attack Isolation**: Let auto-attack run while watching shop buttons - verify no visual flickering
4. **Rapid Purchase Protection**: Click buy buttons as fast as possible, verify only one purchase per click and no state corruption
5. **Concurrent Actions**: Buy upgrades while auto-attack is firing, verify both systems work independently
6. **Level Progression**: Play through levels 1-10, verify XP requirements are reasonable
7. **Laser Origin**: Observe lasers spawning from ship tips in both normal and boss mode
8. **Boss Controls**: Test all movement controls (WASD, arrows, space) in boss fight
9. **Screen Wrapping**: Fly ship off all edges in boss mode, verify wrapping works
10. **Mode Transitions**: Verify smooth transitions between normal ↔ boss modes
11. **State Persistence**: Refresh page, verify level/XP/ships persist correctly
