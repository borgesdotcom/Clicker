# Final Updates & Bug Fixes

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Money Not Withdrawing (FIXED ‚úÖ)
**Problem**: Purchases weren't deducting points correctly.

**Root Cause**: The shop was using `spendPoints()` which modifies state, then calling `setState()` again, and the state being passed wasn't properly synchronized.

**Solution**: 
- Completely rewrote purchase logic in `Shop.ts`
- Direct subtraction: `state.points -= price` before calling `buy()`
- Removed dependency on `spendPoints()` in shop
- Now properly deducts money EVERY time

### 2. Flickering Buy Buttons (FIXED ‚úÖ)
**Problem**: Buttons flickering and becoming unresponsive.

**Root Cause**: Shop was re-rendering immediately on every tiny state change, causing rapid DOM rebuilds.

**Solution**:
- Added **debounced rendering** with 50ms delay
- Added `isRendering` flag to prevent concurrent renders
- Render batches multiple state changes together
- Much smoother and more responsive

### 3. Boss Fight Issues (FIXED ‚úÖ)

#### Auto-Aim Removed
**Problem**: Lasers auto-aimed at boss - no skill required.

**Solution**: 
- Lasers now fire in the direction the player ship is facing
- Must aim manually like real Asteroids
- Shoots 2000px in the facing direction
- Requires actual skill and positioning

#### Boss Only at Level 100
**Problem**: Boss every 5 levels was too frequent.

**Solution**:
- Changed `isBossLevel()` to only return true at level 100
- Boss is now a major milestone achievement
- Reduced HP from exponential scaling to fixed 5000 HP
